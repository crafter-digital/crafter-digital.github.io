        "I'm not going to tell you it doesn't annoy me, because it does annoy me," <b>Zinedine Zidane</b> admitted. "But I can't stop people having their opinions." The problem, he knew, was that it wasn't just "people"; it was those people: men inside the place where he worked, although maybe not for much longer. It was October last year and, while it seems preposterous now and seemed silly even then, Real Madrid's manager was on the edge.

        <li><b>- What did you miss? The latest from Europe's top leagues</b></li>
        <li><b>- Stream ESPN FC Daily seven days a week on ESPN+ (U.S. only)</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Never mind the three European Cups in a row, a feat that's worth repeating. Three. European Cups. In. A. Row. Never mind the 2016-17 league title, one of only two Madrid had won in the previous 12 years. Never mind the fact that he had answered their call for help, returning in a crisis earlier in the year because they needed him when he could have declined and lived off that success forever. The start to the season had not been good; one point from two Champions League games and defeat at Mallorca meant the pressure built, the familiar shadow of Jose Mourinho hovering once more.</p>
